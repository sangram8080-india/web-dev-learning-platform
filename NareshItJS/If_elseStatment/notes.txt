==>if statment is used to verify a condtion

     verify and return student status "pass" or "fail" base on contion > 35



 these statments are used to make a decision/choice so that control flow will cahge base on that decision/choice
 1.if
 2.if,else
 3.nested if
 4.if-else if
 


 Swith statment==:
  increase we have multiple condtion , we can deal them with swith-case 
  2. switch:
   witch is used to trigger respective case/choice base on user's input
   

   syntax:
    switch(exp/statments){
        case value1: 
        statment; break;
        case value2: 
        statment; break;
        case value3: 
        statment; break;
        case value4: 
        statment; break;
        default:
        statment;
    }





Loops ==>
Two types of cotnrol loops :
  1. entry control loop
   ex-while loop
  2. Exit control loop
   ex-do while 




"Javascript is so intuitive and interesting"
find the longest word
function findLongestWord(sentence) {
    return sentence
        .split(" ")                   
        .reduce((longest, current) =>  
            current.length > longest.length ? current : longest, 
            "");                         
}

const sentence = "Javascript is so intuitive and interesting";
console.log(findLongestWord(sentence));  


2."Practice makes javaScript perect"
Reverse every word individually but keep same order
function reverseWords(sentence) {
    return sentence
        .split(" ")
        .map(word => word.split("").reverse().join(""))
        .join(" ");
}

const sentence = "Practice makes javaScript perect";
console.log(reverseWords(sentence));  // Output: "ecitcarP sekam tpircSavaj tcerp"



3. arr = [{name:'raj',marks:50},
{name:'ravi',marks:25},
{name:'vani',marks:85}
]

return qualified student whose marks are (>35)

const arr = [
  { name: 'raj', marks: 50 },
  { name: 'ravi', marks: 25 },
  { name: 'vani', marks: 85 }
];

const qualifiedStudents = arr.filter(student => student.marks > 35);

console.log(qualifiedStudents);
